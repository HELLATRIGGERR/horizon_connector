# Shader API reference (0.1)

Generated from `crates/horizon-shader-api` (`HORIZON_WRITE_DOCS=1 cargo test -p horizon-shader-api --test reference`
rewrites it; the test fails when it drifts). The API's design and pack format: [shaders.md](shaders.md).

A stage is a function your WGSL defines, with the signature below; Horizon puts the prelude (these structs, the
resources and helpers) before your files and calls the function from its own pass. Your files declare no
bindings and no entry points, and no names starting with `horizon_`.

## Stages

| Stage | In `horizon-shaders.toml` | Your function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sky | `[sky]` | `fn sky(input: SkyInput) -> vec4<f32>` |
| material | `[material]` | `fn material(input: MaterialInput) -> Surface` |
| post | `[[post]]` | `fn post(input: PostInput) -> vec4<f32>` |

## sky

`fn sky(input: SkyInput) -> vec4<f32>`

### `SkyInput`

One direction of the sky, for `fn sky(input: SkyInput) -> vec4<f32>`. The sun, moon, stars and clouds are drawn over the result.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `direction` | `vec3<f32>` | Unit view ray, camera-relative world axes. |
| `color` | `vec4<f32>` | Vanilla's sky colour along the ray (sky, fog and sunrise). |

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |

## material

`fn material(input: MaterialInput) -> Surface`

### `MaterialInput`

One point of a block's surface, for `fn material(input: MaterialInput) -> Surface`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `albedo` | `vec4<f32>` | The block texture's colour here (alpha 0..1). |
| `tint` | `vec4<f32>` | The vertex colour: biome tint, face shade and ambient occlusion. |
| `light` | `vec2<f32>` | Block and sky light, 0..1, smoothed over the face. |
| `lightmap` | `vec3<f32>` | Vanilla's light colour for that light this frame. |
| `position` | `vec3<f32>` | The point, camera-relative, in blocks. |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | The texture coordinate inside the block atlas. |
| `translucent` | `bool` | Drawn in the translucent pass (water, stained glass, ice). |
| `tags` | `u32` | The pack's sprite tags this surface's sprite has: bit i for the manifest's i-th `[[tags]]`. |
| `screen` | `vec2<f32>` | Where the point is on the screen, 0..1 from the top left (`opaque_depth` and `opaque_color` at `screen * frame.resolution`). |
| `face` | `u32` | For a fluid, which face of the block the point is on, `Direction` order: 0 down, 1 up, 2 north, 3 south, 4 west, 5 east. 0 elsewhere. |
| `fluid` | `u32` | 0 not a fluid, 1 water, 2 lava. |
| `emission` | `f32` | How strongly the block itself shines, 0..1, by its kind of light: a redstone torch or a candle 7/15, a torch or lava 14/15, glowstone 1; 0 for most blocks. |
| `normal` | `vec3<f32>` | The surface's geometric normal, a unit vector in world axes, facing the camera. A normal within about 3.6 degrees of an axis is that axis exactly, so distant block faces do not shimmer; flowing water's slopes are steeper and keep theirs. |
| `tangent` | `vec4<f32>` | The surface's tangent: xyz the unit direction in world axes along which `uv.x` grows, w the sign (1 or -1) that makes `cross(normal, tangent.xyz) * tangent.w` the direction `uv.y` grows along (down the texture). With `normal` it turns a normal map's normals into world axes. |

### `Surface`

What `material` returns. Vanilla's own is `albedo * tint * vec4(lightmap, 1.0)`; Horizon then applies the alpha test (cutout and translucent) and fog.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `vec4<f32>` | The lit colour, 0..1, with its alpha. |

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |
| 1 | `var reflection: texture_2d<f32>` | The water mirror: the world as a camera mirrored about the horizontal water plane around the camera (`frame.water_plane`) sees it, at half resolution, mapped like the world's picture, so water samples it at `input.screen`. Solid terrain, cut away below the plane, over the vanilla sky gradient: not the pack's `sky` stage, nor the sun, moon and stars. Drawn only for a pack whose material reads it, while `frame.has_reflection` is 1; else a 1×1 blank. |
| 2 | `var reflection_sampler: sampler` | Bilinear filtering, clamped to the edges. |
| 6 | `var opaque_depth: texture_depth_2d` | The world's depth before translucent terrain (reversed, like `scene_depth`), for the translucent pass: `textureLoad(opaque_depth, vec2<i32>(input.screen * frame.resolution), 0)` is what lies behind water or glass. Stale while solid terrain draws. |
| 11 | `var opaque_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The world's picture before translucent terrain (sky, solid terrain, entities), the size of `opaque_depth`, for the translucent pass: what a surface refracts. Read it with `textureLoad`. Stale while solid terrain draws; black when the world draws straight to the window (a pack without `[[post]]` passes, at full resolution). |

## post

`fn post(input: PostInput) -> vec4<f32>`

### `PostInput`

One pixel of the picture, for `fn post(input: PostInput) -> vec4<f32>`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | Where the pixel is, 0..1 from the top left. |
| `pixel` | `vec2<f32>` | The pixel's centre, in pixels from the top left of what the pass draws (the world's size; the window's for the last pass). |
| `color` | `vec4<f32>` | The previous pass's colour here (the world's picture for the first pass). |
| `depth` | `f32` | The world's depth here, reversed: 0 is the sky. |

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |
| 1 | `var scene_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The world's picture before any pass. |
| 2 | `var scene_depth: texture_depth_2d` | The world's depth, reversed (1 near, 0 far and sky). |
| 3 | `var previous: texture_2d<f32>` | The previous pass's output (`scene_color` for the first pass). |
| 4 | `var linear_sampler: sampler` | Bilinear filtering, clamped to the edges. |
| 5 | `var nearest_sampler: sampler` | Nearest texel, clamped to the edges. |
| 8 | `var history: texture_2d<f32>` | Last frame's input to the last pass (what the pass before it wrote), for temporal passes (TAA, denoising): put such a pass second to last and it reads its own previous output; reproject with `frame.previous_view_projection`. Black on the first frame, after a gap of over half a second, and with a single pass. |

Helpers:

- `fn depth_at(uv: vec2<f32>) -> f32`: the world's depth at `uv`.
- `fn view_position(uv: vec2<f32>, depth: f32) -> vec3<f32>`: the camera-relative position, in blocks, of
  the point at `uv` and `depth`.

## The frame

### `Frame`

The frame, as `frame` in every stage. Positions and directions are in world axes relative to the camera (x east, y up, z south), so they stay precise far from the world's origin; depth is reversed (1 near, 0 at the far plane and in the sky).

## Options

Each `[[options]]` entry sets the WGSL `override` of the same name when the pipelines are built:

| `type` | Keys | The `override` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bool` | `default` | `override <id>: bool` |
| `float` | `default`, `min`, `max`, `step` | `override <id>: f32` |
| `int` | `default`, `min`, `max` | `override <id>: i32` |
| `choice` | `values`, `default` (one of them) | `override <id>: u32`, the value's index |

## Limits

- 8 post passes, 64 options, `budget.gpu_ms` up to 16.
- 256 KiB per WGSL file, 8 MiB per pack.
- Per stage: 20000 naga expressions over all its functions, 64 texture reads (samples,
  gathers and loads, the prelude's included).

## The check

A pack runs only after it passes `horizon_shader_api::check` (the game when it loads a pack, the launcher before it
installs one, the registry's CI): each stage is parsed and validated by naga, checked against its signature and
the rules above, and translated for Vulkan (SPIR-V), Metal and DirectX 12 (HLSL) with its options at their
defaults, minimums and maximums. Every option must be an `override` of its type in some stage; an `override`
that is no option needs a default.
